The JCP web site for the JSR80 is: http://jcp.org/detail/80.jsp
The location of this modification is http://javax-usb.sourceforge.net

****************
* Requirements *
****************

Java      Standard Edition version 1.2 or greater - Micro Edition has not been tested but may work
ANT       http://jakarta.apache.org/ant (make sure to get the optional.jar file!)

*********
* Build *
*********

The ANT tool uses XML buildfiles to create the project.  The default
name for the buildfile is 'build.xml'.  The default target (for the
buildfile provided) is 'help'.

Since the buildfile provided is called 'build.xml', you don't need to
specify it.  The help target (which is the default target if no target
is specified) lists all available targets.

To build the API, simply

% ant all

Then add the .class jarfile, which is placed (by default) in the lib/
directory, to your CLASSPATH.

****************
* Installation *
****************

Create the .class jarfile (jsr80.jar) and put it into your CLASSPATH.
